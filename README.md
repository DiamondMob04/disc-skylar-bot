# disc-skylar-bot
A bot that was initially created for a friend's server, but became just a thing I worked on in ninth grade for fun. 
Fully functional Discord bot with certain administrative and economy commands.
Add the bot to your server here: [Bot OAuth Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=658755807210635295&permissions=8&scope=bot)
I also added a small Unity WebGL game as an added bonus, so I don't have to host a discord bot and a website for my game both at once.
